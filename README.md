## Introduction
Nowadays, people  pay more attention to their health than anytime before. How to lose weight have been a hot topic all over the world.
Generally, people do more exercise/work out and eat healthier to achieve this goal. In my experience, opening a fitness center is more expensive than opening a restaurant. So I would like to focus on healthy food.
In this project, I want to open a restaurant that focuses on low GI diet.  I choose Kaohsiung city as my target city. It is the second large city in Taiwan.
I will collect and analyze some data to get the best location in the chosen city for a low GI restaurant.

## Data
1. Districts data is scraped from wikipedia.
2. Detailed census data is downloaded from website of Kaohsiung government and Taiwan government. 
3. Geospatial data is from geopy and foursquare. 


## Methodology
1. I do background research by google and ask a friend born in Kaohsiung city.
2. I search statistical information on wikipedia and government websites.
3. I gather needed data by scraping and Foursquare API. And I also manually download some CSVs and reports from websites.
4. I analyze the data using data science methods and my personal experiences.

## Example analysis
### Visualize important factors like **income * population** and **venues** on the map.

## Result
Using the knowledge I learned from IBM data science classes, I am able to determine where is the best location for a low GI restaurant.

### Best location of my restaurant is at this circle/roundabout.

## I also found the real view of this location from google map.
## I can rent/buy 1F of the building for sale at the left side of the screenshot **(If I have enough money)**.
