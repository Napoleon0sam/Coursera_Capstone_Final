# Coursera_Capstone_Final

## Introduction
Nowadays, people  pay more attention to their health than anytime before. How to lose weight have been a hot topic all over the world.
Generally, people do more exercise/work out and eat healthier to achieve this goal. In my experience, opening a fitness center is more expensive than opening a restaurant. So I would like to focus on healthy food.
In this project, I want to open a restaurant that focuses on low GI diet.  I choose Kaohsiung city as my target city. It is the second large city in Taiwan.
I will collect and analyze some data to get the best location in the chosen city for a low GI restaurant.

## Data
1. Districts data is scraped from wikipedia.
2. Detailed census data is downloaded from website of Kaohsiung government and Taiwan government. 
3. Geospatial data is from geopy and foursquare.
